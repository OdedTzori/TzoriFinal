Tutorial/Overview
I followed a tutorial in order to make this project. The project does not work, nor is completely fully, since I could not find anyway to download the needed imports from badlogic (wherever it exists). When I took on this project, I wanted to learn how creating an android application is different than just making a game on eclipse.

The structure of the project is quite simple, but a little difficult to understand initially. For each “State” of the game, a different class is created; hence their being a MenuState and a PlayState class. There could also be created a PauseState class for when the game is paused. Those State classes are managed by the class GameStateManager, which is sort of the over-arching class. For each State classes, there are other classes being used in order to run the game, such as Bird class. That is the structure of the project, pretty simple to explain, but it was not that easy to understand. 
I stopped working on the project after creating the Bird class for multiple reasons. Primarily I was getting annoyed that no matter how much of the tutorial I followed I would not be able to see my project work at the end. However I also understood how the structure of Android Studio works which is what I set out to learn in the beginning of starting this project. 

For anybody who wants to learn how to make an Android app, I do not suggest using Dobervich’s java final project to learn to do so for a few reasons. First of all, the amount of time to work on it is limited which greatly affects your ability to learn all that you hopefully want to. More importantly, your experience with JDKs is extremely narrow, as is your experience with programming. While you might like programming on Eclipse, it is much easier to follow a teacher who has experience with teaching students in a class setting than a tutorial on youtube where questions cannot be answered.
Do not let this scare you into not wanting to learn how to make an Android app, or how to use Android Studio. Very useful skills, especially for somebody who is interested in continuing with computer science past high school. Finding continual motivation for this project was not easy, especially when facing sure failure. I do not mean to tell you to not do it, if you believe in yourself go for it. I just give you my two cents as a warning. Good luck!
